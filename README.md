# Welcome! This small project was inspired by [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) 


## The goal was to replicate this design:

![SignUpForm](https://res.cloudinary.com/dz209s6jk/image/upload/v1559829911/Challenges/cbyamvcsyhwlvnlelr5n.jpg)


## Technologies used for the challenge:
**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**


# The users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
